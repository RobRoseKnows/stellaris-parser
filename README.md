# Stellaris Parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/RobRoseKnows/stellaris-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/RobRoseKnows/stellaris-parser)

Yeah this is a thing I'm making to help with another project I'm working on. This part is
open source because it's useful for others. WIP, does not work at this time. Pull requests
will likely auto-fail Travis due to the secret environment variables. Don't try anything at
this time.
